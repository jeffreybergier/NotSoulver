MathEdit is a calculator app and text editor built into one. MathEdit intelligently looks for mathematical formulas in your text documents and solves them in-line. With MathEdit you will never need to open the calculator app to manually calculate the answer to a math problem to put into your note.

Just type 3*14= and MathEdit will insert the 42 for you. As well, MathEdit will give special formatting to the answer as well as the rest of the formula. All features include:

In-line math expression solving
- In-line math expression solving
- PEMDAS order of operations
- Basic operators + - / * ^
- Roots e.g. 4R256= (cube root of 256)
- Logarithms e.g. 10L1000= (log base 10 of 1000)
- Carries over previous solution
- Syntax highlighting
- Theme-able with customer fonts and colors
- Dark Mode
- Physical keyboard and Virtual Keypad
- Autosave and Autoresume so data is never lost 

If you got this far in the description, you might be interested to know that MathEdit was built as a learning exercise. It's an app that runs in every version of Mac OS X ever released, including OpenStep 4.2 which was the technical precursor to Mac OS X.
